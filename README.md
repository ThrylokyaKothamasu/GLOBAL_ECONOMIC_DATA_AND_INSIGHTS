# GLOBAL_ECONOMIC_DATA_AND_INSIGHTS

I've been involved in a project centered around "Data Analytics," specifically focusing on the theme of "GLOBAL ECONOMIC DATA - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS."

In the midst of increasing complexity in recent years, the significance of data analytics cannot be overstated. Through the utilization of a Flask-built website and various data analytics tools and techniques, this project aims to assist organizations, policymakers, and researchers in extracting valuable insights from "GLOBAL ECONOMIC DATA."

The generated insights play a crucial role in enhancing decision-making processes.

**Technology Architecture:**

1. **IBM Cognos:** This platform serves as a data-driven business intelligence and performance management tool. It facilitates the generation of actionable insights and reports.

2. **Python:** Renowned for its versatility and power, Python is employed extensively for data analytics, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications.

3. **Django:** As a web framework, Django empowers data analysts to construct interactive data visualization and reporting applications.

4. **Flask:** Recognized for its lightweight nature, Flask is often chosen for deploying data analytics APIs and web applications.
